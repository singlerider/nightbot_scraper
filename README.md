## Installation
### Virtual Environment
I would recommend running this in a virtual environment to keep your dependencies in check. If you'd like to do that, run:

```shell
sudo pip install virtualenv
```

Followed by:

```shell
virtualenv venv
```

This will create an empty virtualenv in your project directory in a folder called "venv." To enable it, run:

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

and your console window will be in that virtualenv state. To deactivate, run:

```shell
deactivate
```

### Dependencies
To install all dependencies locally (preferably inside your activated virtualenv), run:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
